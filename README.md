Hackathon project
Equation Parser is a java application that can analyze the syntactical perfection of  mathematical equations.
This application uses the various libraries that comes prebuilt with Java Developer Kit (JDK). 

#Functionality
Equation Parser takes one or more mathematical equations as input.
These equations will be passed through multiple syntax checkers which checks the validity of each part of the equation.
After the analysis, the application will print the validity of the equation.
The application can accept the basic arithmetic operators like +, -, /, *.
The application has the capability to calculate the basic trigonometric functions like SIN, COS, TAN and other java related mathematical functions like sqrt, ^ (power).
The application can also parse the equations with variables. The application reads the values of these variables from user input and validates the equation.
